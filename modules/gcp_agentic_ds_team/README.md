# README for GCP Agentic Data Science Team Terraform module

## Overview
This module provisions a GCP-based Agentic Data Science team for the full lifecycle of fraud binary classifier models, from data discovery to model deployment. It includes a GCS bucket for data and artifact storage and Vertex AI for model training and serving.

## Features
- Agentic team with capabilities: data discovery, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, experiment tracking, and deployment
- GCS bucket for data and model artifacts
- Designed for fraud detection binary classification use cases
- Vertex AI for model training and endpoint deployment

## Usage
```hcl
module "gcp_agentic_ds_team" {
  source = "./modules/gcp_agentic_ds_team"
  # Optionally override variables
  # gcp_fraud_data_bucket_name = "my-ds-bucket"
  # gcp_location = "us-central1"
  # gcp_vertex_model_image = "gcr.io/my-project/my-image:latest"
  # gcp_vertex_model_artifact_gcs_uri = "gs://my-ds-bucket/model/"
}
```

## Outputs
- `gcp_fraud_data_bucket_name`: The GCS bucket for artifacts
- `gcp_vertex_ai_endpoint_id`: The Vertex AI endpoint for inference

## Requirements
- Google Cloud project with Vertex AI and GCS enabled
- Terraform Google provider

## Limitations

**Note:** As of May 2025, Vertex AI model and endpoint deployment is not supported by the official Terraform Google provider. You must deploy models and endpoints using the gcloud CLI, Python SDK, or the GCP Console. This module provisions GCS and other supported infra only.
